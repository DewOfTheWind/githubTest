  <p class="paragraph_about_design">
    Following a desire to educate a small team of individuals Sharon McKeny and James Westman began the company Geordie Apparel,
    a clothing brand with the objective of creating family-friendly, quality, affordable clothing. The idea was a hit and brought about many customers,
    The stores were not enough to handle and reach out to all of the customers and so the company decidded to make some changes.
    A year later, Geordie Apparel moved all focus to online stores. 
   <em>We've got the best threads in the toon</em>

    <div class="review">
      <p class="paragraph_review_design">“I just stumbled across this website, when I was going through my student's websites when i Learned about 'Geordie Apparel.'
          My first impression was that this site was just another clothing capitalist. But I must say, the way that the brand goes above and beyond
          just to help customers find 'the perfect outfit.' I am more than likely to shop here for all my designer needs. It was so good, I had to leave a review.'
